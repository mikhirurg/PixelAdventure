Hi guys!
This is my first game on pygame)
Here you can collect coins and find the exit of level.
Play the game with arrows and mouse.
In file "CONFIG.TXT" you can choose level of the game.
If you want to create level you can open your notepad and write something like this:
On first line you must write width of your level on second line write height.
(width must be equals height!)
then type enter
and you can start creating level:
"0"-brick wall
"~"-water
" "-ground
"."-grass
"F"-finish level
"1"-coin
Then you create level open file "CONFIG.TXT" and after line "MAP:" write name of the level file
I think you enjoy my game)
